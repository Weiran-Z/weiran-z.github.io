The Year Compass
2024-12-31
-->

<p>Hey friend, how was your December? It's crazy that 2024 is almost over. Have you set your New Year's resolutions yet?</p>
<p>I spent the last couple of days looking back on the past year and planning the next one. I went through last year‚Äôs album month by month. It reminds me of important events, family gatherings, friendly get-togethers, and significant projects that I had.</p>
<p><strong>2024 is a year full of change, exploration, and self-improvement for me personally.</strong></p>
<p>As I reflected on my achievements, I'm very proud of things I'd pushed myself to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>I signed myself up for an English literature class. It was a deliberate choice with a slight pivot. Originally I wanted to be better at presenting my ideas or insights comprehensively and thoroughly to native speakers. Another goal was to be able to understand puns, idioms, and double entendres in movies/shows without subtitles. Basically, improving my English (it's a lifelong lesson!)</li>
</ul>
<p>I ended up reading Dune with my teacher and having close analysis conversation each week. Oliver has always been inspiring by asking me thoughtful questions. He's such a knowledgeable and passionate master in the literature field. I was super lucky to have him on my learning team.</p>
<p><img alt="lit teacher" src="/imgs/Oliver%20in%20Literature%20class.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Made more friends by hosting coffee chat events and joining a book club. I met about 50 folks this year. (This number exceeds the friends I made in the past 3 years combined!) I also reconnected to my old friends from childhood and college. I'm convinced people who share the tears with you are the closest to you. So thank you for weeping with me, Peiwei!</li>
</ul>
<p>Being haunted by loneliness my entire life had me realize social interactions and emotional well-being are strongly related. Physical social interactions cultivate a deeper sense of meaning and happiness. Shout out to people who met up with me! I had joy hanging out with you all!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The biggest thing I completed was I finally got my personal website done! If you had learned programming, you would know what I'm talking about. You pick up a book or an online class, and think you will finish this soon and nail it with a wonderful product made your own. Then you encounter some problems or a simple challenge that you just can't get over. You struggle for a while, procrastinate, and eventually give up. You might comfort yourself by saying: "it's ok, I'll fix the issue soon when I'm in the mood." But you are never really in the mood or get a chance. No progress was made. The next time when you are ready to pick it up again, you forget most of what you learned. You start the process again. You drain yourself by repeating this cycle 3 or 4 times until you give up completely. Luckily, I had help from a dearest friend who constantly asked me to get it done! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning to play an instrument has always been hard for me. Well, at least it's in my head. Surprisingly, I self-learned music theory and how to play 2 pieces of music. It all started feeling bored during last Christmas and picked up the music theory book to read. I guess boredom does stimulate creativity? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For self-care, I made time for the gym 3 times a week, enjoyed a lot of sushi and poke, and indulged myself in healthy activities (rollercoasters, hot spring spa, billie eilish concert * 2!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traveling each year is an important part of my Rich Life Vision. In 2024, I had the opportunity to explore a few exciting cities: Chicago, Guangzhou, Kyoto, Osaka, Nara, Denver, and Hawaii. Each destination offered me unique experiences and memories. A lot of first-time experiences! </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How did your 2024 look like? Have you achieved something? Feel free to let me know! </p>
<p>I've made my magical wishes for the year ahead. I hope your 2025 will be fruitful, and full of love and joy! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

<h3>Before I go......</h3>
<p>I'm reading The New York Times column The Morning, here‚Äôs some of the best advice that readers received this year and made me relate to. I wanted to share with you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do something today your tomorrow self will thank you for. ‚Äî Ava Shaffer, Cincinnati</li>
<li>People who avoid their own feelings will neglect yours. ‚Äî Jennifer Pagliaroli, Bethlehem, Pa.</li>
<li>‚ÄúShake the tree,‚Äù my mom advised. ‚ÄúYou never know what will fall out.‚Äù Put another way: It never hurts to ask. I shook the tree this year and some great things came about: a new mentor, a penalty waived for a late submission, a free plate of zeppoles. ‚Äî Jennifer Suzukawa-Tseng, New York City</li>
<li>Attend funerals for relatives of people you don‚Äôt know really well. It is the kindest thing you can do for an acquaintance. ‚Äî John Immerwahr, Bryn Mawr, Pa.</li>
<li>Love shows up. ‚Äî Kathy Fry, Grosse Pointe, Mich.</li>
<li>Some seasons you produce fruit, some seasons you prune, and some seasons you let your roots grow deep. ‚Äî Jonathan Berry, Berea, Ky.</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt be the one to tell yourself no. ‚Äî Skye Verhofste, Des Moines</li>
<li>The world is run by those who show up. ‚Äî April Conway, Reno, Nev.</li>
</ul>

We all find our own way to grow and thrive

<blockquote>
<p>Q:
Would you say the below paragraph is accurate?  I‚Äôm reading a book and was wondering what a Chinese native thought. Thanks.</p>
<p>Much of this growth continued in the early years of Xi Jinping, who in 2013 became China‚Äôs ‚Äúparamount leader‚Äù‚Äîthe only man since Mao to hold all three titles of head of state, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, and chairman of the Central Military Commission‚Äîbut in the last few years, growth has started to slow, with many predicting a downturn. Xi has sought to preserve the economic benefits of Deng‚Äôs market reforms while reimposing Mao‚Äôs centralized power and restrictions on free enterprise and speech, and reconverting China into a quasi‚Äìpolice state. The difference now is that Xi has access to technology that Mao never even dreamed of: Facial recognition, AI surveillance networks, mobile and internet monitoring, and social credit systems are being deployed to turn China, once again‚Äîand like every socialist paradise‚Äîinto a prison. If Chinese citizens before Xi had only some of the freedom and liberties Americans enjoy under the Bill of Rights, they now have none. Even their freedom of movement‚Äîtheir right to buy a bus ticket to visit a family member‚Äîdepends on their support for the regime.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>A:</h3>
<p>Regarding the restriction on freedom of movement, it's partially justified. It's not solely tied to supporting the party; rather, individuals with negative public records face limitations on public transportation. These records include criminal activities, financial delinquencies (such as loan defaults or involvement with illegal insurers), and administrative penalties (like gambling, drug offenses, or spreading political rumors).</p>
<p>In general, a good citizen doesn‚Äôt get into trouble¬†or have freedom restrictions.¬†Many don't perceive themselves as having less freedom than Americans until they venture abroad.</p>
<p>When discussing freedom, its definition plays a pivotal role. For instance, while the German government recommends for speed limits on highways, drivers are free to accelerate on de-restricted sections of autobahns. Most Americans don't feel deprived of driving freedom due to this. Similarly, perceptions of freedom in China hinge on various interpretations. Personally, I view freedom as a relative notion.</p>
<p>Indeed, major constraints in China revolve around free enterprise and speech. Given its vast population and territory, diverse opinions abound. Embracing multi-party systems could risk plunging China into historical chaos. The resilience of Chinese civilization stems not only from patriotism but also from a deeply ingrained sense of unity.</p>
<p>Centralized power has its merits and drawbacks.</p>
<p>Firstly, centralization fosters support for multi-ethnic autonomy. China's fifty-six ethnic groups, with fifty-five being minorities (I belong to one üòä), form relatively closed social networks due to linguistic and cultural differences. In such a scenario, a central node emerges as a connecting point, as illustrated by the Qing Dynasty's network diagram with the emperor at its center. Implementing decentralized democracy across such a diverse empire, especially spanning civilizations, is impractical.</p>
<p>Secondly, centralization enhances emergency response capabilities.¬†</p>
<p>Responding to the pandemic¬†in 2020 is a good example. The Chinese government quickly implemented a series of rules and they effectively controlled the virus spread even though citizens had to lose the freedom of going out of the house for a short period of time.¬†</p>
<p>Furthermore, centralized power facilitates the execution of long-term plans. China's economic blueprints spanning five to ten years benefit from focused efforts without the need for local consent or protracted parliamentary debates.</p>
<p>However, the drawbacks are apparent. If the party prioritizes its interests over citizens', people become oppressed subjects. In the business world, collusion among managers in centralized entities often results in data manipulation to the detriment of customers. In contrast, decentralized systems ensure independent and parallel operations, fostering transparency and safeguarding customer interests.</p>
<p>Overall, China has been¬†finding¬†its¬†way from its¬†long history to grow and thrive.</p>
