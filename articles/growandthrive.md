> Much of this growth continued in the early years of Xi Jinping, who in 2013 became China’s “paramount leader”—the only man since Mao to hold all three titles of head of state, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, and chairman of the Central Military Commission—but in the last few years, growth has started to slow, with many predicting a downturn. Xi has sought to preserve the economic benefits of Deng’s market reforms while reimposing Mao’s centralized power and restrictions on free enterprise and speech, and reconverting China into a quasi–police state. The difference now is that Xi has access to technology that Mao never even dreamed of: Facial recognition, AI surveillance networks, mobile and internet monitoring, and social credit systems are being deployed to turn China, once again—and like every socialist paradise—into a prison. If Chinese citizens before Xi had only some of the freedom and liberties Americans enjoy under the Bill of Rights, they now have none. Even their freedom of movement—their right to buy a bus ticket to visit a family member—depends on their support for the regime.

### A:
Regarding the restriction on freedom of movement, it's partially justified. It's not solely tied to supporting the party; rather, individuals with negative public records face limitations on public transportation. These records include criminal activities, financial delinquencies (such as loan defaults or involvement with illegal insurers), and administrative penalties (like gambling, drug offenses, or spreading political rumors).

In general, a good citizen doesn’t get into trouble or have freedom restrictions. Many don't perceive themselves as having less freedom than Americans until they venture abroad.

When discussing freedom, its definition plays a pivotal role. For instance, while the German government recommends for speed limits on highways, drivers are free to accelerate on de-restricted sections of autobahns. Most Americans don't feel deprived of driving freedom due to this. Similarly, perceptions of freedom in China hinge on various interpretations. Personally, I view freedom as a relative notion.

Indeed, major constraints in China revolve around free enterprise and speech. Given its vast population and territory, diverse opinions abound. Embracing multi-party systems could risk plunging China into historical chaos. The resilience of Chinese civilization stems not only from patriotism but also from a deeply ingrained sense of unity.

Centralized power has its merits and drawbacks.

Firstly, centralization fosters support for multi-ethnic autonomy. China's fifty-six ethnic groups, with fifty-five being minorities (I belong to one 😊), form relatively closed social networks due to linguistic and cultural differences. In such a scenario, a central node emerges as a connecting point, as illustrated by the Qing Dynasty's network diagram with the emperor at its center. Implementing decentralized democracy across such a diverse empire, especially spanning civilizations, is impractical.

Secondly, centralization enhances emergency response capabilities. 

Responding to the pandemic in 2020 is a good example. The Chinese government quickly implemented a series of rules and they effectively controlled the virus spread even though citizens had to lose the freedom of going out of the house for a short period of time. 

Furthermore, centralized power facilitates the execution of long-term plans. China's economic blueprints spanning five to ten years benefit from focused efforts without the need for local consent or protracted parliamentary debates.

However, the drawbacks are apparent. If the party prioritizes its interests over citizens', people become oppressed subjects. In the business world, collusion among managers in centralized entities often results in data manipulation to the detriment of customers. In contrast, decentralized systems ensure independent and parallel operations, fostering transparency and safeguarding customer interests.

Overall, China has been finding its way from its long history to grow and thrive.
