The Year Compass

Hey friend, how was your December? It's crazy that 2024 is almost over. Have you set your New Year's resolutions yet?

I spent the last couple of days looking back on the past year and planning the next one. I went through last year’s album month by month. It reminds me of important events, family gatherings, friendly get-togethers, and significant projects that I had.

**2024 is a year full of change, exploration, and self-improvement for me personally.**

As I reflected on my achievements, I'm very proud of things I'd pushed myself to do:

- I signed myself up for an English literature class. It was a deliberate choice with a slight pivot. Originally I wanted to be better at presenting my ideas or insights comprehensively and thoroughly to native speakers. Another goal was to be able to understand puns, idioms, and double entendres in movies/shows without subtitles. Basically, improving my English (it's a lifelong lesson!)

  I ended up reading Dune with my teacher and having close analysis conversation each week. Oliver has always been inspiring by asking me thoughtful questions. He's such a knowledgeable and passionate master in the literature field. I was super lucky to have him on my learning team.

- Made more friends by hosting coffee chat events and joining a book club. I met about 50 folks this year. (This number exceeds the friends I made in the past 3 years combined!) I also reconnected to my old friends from childhood and college. I'm convinced people who share the tears with you are the closest to you. So thank you for weeping with me, Peiwei!

  Being haunted by loneliness my entire life had me realize social interactions and emotional well-being are strongly related. Physical social interactions cultivate a deeper sense of meaning and happiness. Shout out to people who met up with me! I had joy hanging out with you all!

- The biggest thing I completed was I finally got my personal website done! If you had learned programming, you would know what I'm talking about. You pick up a book or an online class, and think you will finish this soon and nail it with a wonderful product made your own. Then you encounter some problems or a simple challenge that you just can't get over. You struggle for a while, procrastinate, and eventually give up. You might comfort yourself by saying: "it's ok, I'll fix the issue soon when I'm in the mood." But you are never really in the mood or get a chance. No progress was made. The next time when you are ready to pick it up again, you forget most of what you learned. You start the process again. You drain yourself by repeating this cycle 3 or 4 times until you give up completely. Luckily, I had help from a dearest friend who constantly asked me to get it done! 

- Learning to play an instrument has always been hard for me. Well, at least it's in my head. Surprisingly, I self-learned music theory and how to play 2 pieces of music. It all started feeling bored during last Christmas and picked up the music theory book to read. I guess boredom does stimulate creativity? 

- For self-care, I made time for the gym 3 times a week, enjoyed a lot of sushi and poke, and indulged myself in healthy activities (rollercoasters, hot spring spa, billie eilish concert * 2!)

- Traveling each year is an important part of my Rich Life Vision. In 2024, I had the opportunity to explore a few exciting cities: Chicago, Guangzhou, Kyoto, Osaka, Nara, Denver, and Hawaii. Each destination offered me unique experiences and memories. A lot of first-time experiences! 

How did your 2024 look like? Have you achieved something? Feel free to let me know! 

I've made my magical wishes for the year ahead. I hope your 2025 will be fruitful, and full of love and joy! ❤️
